# Welcome to evercrisp üë®‚ÄçüíªüöÄ

The ultimate developer configuration for macOS devices

## What about it?

`evercrisp` is based on [Atlassian's approach to dotfiles](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). Basically, your home folder acts just like a git repository. It's a simple, customizable and elegant way to manage your macOS configuration and settings.

As Atlassian puts it:

> No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system, you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you configuration easily on new installation.

## How does it work exactly? 

`evercrisp` works just like `git`. You can add, commit, pull, push any new or existing file. Here's a simple example:

```sh
evercrisp add file
evercrisp commit -m "Adding new file to my dotfiles"
evercrisp push
```

That's it! It's just an alias.
